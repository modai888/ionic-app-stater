# ngImgCrop - manually built version of https://github.com/iblank/ngImgCrop

This library is a manually built version of https://github.com/iblank/ngImgCrop which itself is a fork of the original
ngImgCrop directive (https://github.com/alexk111/ngImgCrop).

The difference is that the fork (github.com/iblank/ngImgCrop) allows rectangular (non-square) crop areas, while the
original version (github.com/alexk111/ngImgCrop) supports only square cropping areas.
 
Build process: cloned the repo:

git clone https://github.com/iblank/ngImgCrop

and then did a "gulp" build.
